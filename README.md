## Description
This is a smaller version of the other project that I worked on using AI and Spotify to create a mood playlist using the user's mood input. This one only uses AI API calls to OpenRouter API using my own API KEY. This project doesn't include making your own account to use the application.
## Installation Instructions
1. Use `npm i` to install all dependencies
## Usage Instructions
### Running the project locally
#### Requirement
You need to create and generate your own OpenRouter API Key and create a `.env ` file on the base directory. The key must be under the name `OPENROUTER_API_TOKEN`
Example (in .env file):
```
OPENROUTER_API_TOKEN=insertkeyhere
```
1. Use `npm run build` in the terminal to compile the project
2. Use `npm run preview` to run the project
3. On your web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:4173` to access the website
